The R programming language was designed to work with data at all stages of the data analysis process. In this part of the course, you’ll examine how R can help you structure, organize, and clean your data using functions and other processes. You’ll learn about data frames and how to work with them in R. You’ll also revisit the issue of data bias and how R can help.
